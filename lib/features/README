In this folder, several feature extraction tools are stored. If you want to write a new tool, please assure that there is:

- an "__init__(self, setup)" function that initializes the feature extractor. The setup is dependent on the extraction tool and read from a config file.
- a "__call__(self, image) -> feature" function that extracts a feature from the given image


Additionally, you can have functions to learn the feature extraction from a given list of training files:

- a "train(self, image_list, extractor_file)" function that learns the feature extraction model from the given list of images and writes the model to the given extractor_file,
- and a "load(self, extractor_file)" function that loads the feature extraction model from file.
