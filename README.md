**Warning**: This repository is now **DEPRECATED**. This library is deprecated
and no longer maintained.

It has been superseded by the `bob.bio` packages, which can be [downloaded from
PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bob.bio.base). These packages are direct
successors of this library and `bob.spear`, incorporating a *broader* set
functionality to run biometric recognition algorithms in general. Please read
the [documentation of the bob.bio
packages](http://pythonhosted.org/bob.bio.base/index.html), particularly the
[installation
instructions](http://pythonhosted.org/bob.bio.base/installation.html).

As a side note, notice Bob is now maintained in
[Gitlab](https://gitlab.idiap.ch/groups/bob). Our
[homepage](https://www.idiap.ch/software/bob/) continues active and will
re-direct you to up-to-date links. Don't report issues here, post them together
