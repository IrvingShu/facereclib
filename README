This is the facereclib toolkit, designed to run (face) verification/recognition
experiments with the SGE grid infrastructure at Idiap.

It requires both:
- gridtk
- bob

Before launching experiments, you need
- to create/update the symbolic link gridtk pointing to your installation
  of the gridtk, in the facereclib/ directory.
- to specify which torch installation should be used. This can for instance be done in the shell.py file
  (by default: /idiap/group/torch5spro/nightlies/last)

Please look at the documentation for (some) more details.
Feel free to do any kind of improvements.
